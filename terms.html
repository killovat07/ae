                    <p><b>2.1.</b> Subject to the terms of this Agreement, we will pay Affiliate for each Qualified
                        Action (the
                        “Commission”). A “Qualified Action” means a natural person who:(1) Made access to the Program
                        Web
                        Site through the Link, where the Link is the last link to the Program Web Site;(2) Is not an
                        artificially generated user or fraudulent traffic, for invalid Conversions, which may originate
                        (for
                        example without limitation) from automatic openings, spiders, robots, requests in email or chat
                        rooms, script generators, placing links on websites other than those informed, and clicks which
                        are
                        not generated by a browser or clicks which are not preceded by an active act of a true visitor
                        who
                        wants to reach a specific website;(3) Does not use pre-filled fields;(4) Fills in all the
                        information required for such action within the time frames established by us and/or our
                        Partners;(5) In future is not defined by us and/or our Partners to be incomplete, fraudulent,
                        unqualified or a duplicate;(6) At a later time does not claim a refund or force a chargeback or
                        reverse payment. Moreover, an action which is not a transaction or sale from the country of
                        origin
                        can be rejected.</p>
                    <p><b>2.2.</b> We may decline any action which is not constituted as a Qualified Action under this
                        Agreement as
                        amended periodically. For all Affiliate Programs that consider a chargeable action to be a sale
                        (i.e. Pay Per Sale), based on the partners request we have a right to take such actions: if an
                        Affiliate is rewarded for a given Qualified Action but is subsequently refunded for the
                        corresponding sale, later the commission sum refunded for this Action can be withdrawn from any
                        other commission due to the Affiliate. Please take into consideration that if an end-user in the
                        process of subscription is using a prepaid card that is impossible to rebill, you will receive
                        the
                        exact sum of their payment, not the default Pay Per Sale.</p>
                    <p><b>2.3.</b> Our payments for the commissions are based on the Net30 schedule, upon condition that
                        your
                        account presently generates more than $2000 per month for Wire Transfer, Paxum, and PayPal ($250
                        for
                        Bitcoin, USDT). Weekly fees can take place if your weekly gain is greater than $1500 for Wire
                        Transfer, Paxum, and PayPal payment methods on a continuous basis, but on condition that you
                        have an
                        agreement with your account manager. If the required limit of $1500 is not achieved, even once,
                        we
                        will downgrade your payment plan and commissions will be paid on a Net30 basis in lieu of a
                        weekly
                        one. If you would like to shift to the weekly-basis payments (Net7) once more, you must achieve
                        the
                        stated limit 5 (five) weeks in sequence, after that condition is met, you will be upgraded to
                        weekly
                        payments. To get paid through Bank transfer, Paxum or PayPal your income must be at least $2000,
                        whether or not you have a weekly or monthly payment. Responsibility for all bank transaction
                        fees
                        will be divided equally between you and us if commissions exceed $2000. If the balance of your
                        account is less than the Minimum Balance, it will be moved to the next month over and over until
                        it
                        reaches the Minimum Balance. If the Qualified Action did not meet the requirements listed in
                        para
                        2.1., we have the right to charge back payments for such Qualified Actions. Relations between
                        you
                        and the Company cannot be determined as employment relations since you are an affiliate and act
                        as
                        an independent contractor. You take sole responsibility for paying any social security costs,
                        fees
                        and/or taxes based on profit made through the Company.</p>
